<h2>Hi, I'm Titash </h2>

- Just built [Forced Move](https://forced-move.onrender.com/)

- I'm a software engineer who loves building apps that make life a little more fun, help you learn something new, or just make things easier as you go about your day. Maybe even make you think.  

- Examples of areas/domains where I have been able to contribute in the past are : 
  * **Recommendation systems** pertaining to luxury and fast fashion products, food and entertainment. 
  * **Sleep science** detecting and predicting bodily conditions based on biosignals recorded while a person sleeps.
  * **Price modelling** tasks such as adjusting pricing/developing pricing models for marketplace based businesses Eg: Uber (service oriented marketplace), Amazon (Ecommerce oriented marketplace), Rover (Specialty marketplace). 
  * **Natural language processing** tasks such as : entity linking, relation extraction, semantic evaluation pertaining to fairy tales
  * **Building intelligent, adaptive systems**
  * **Retrieval Augmented Generation** : ingestion optimization using knowledge graphs and metadata, retrieval and generation optimization techniques including small to big retrieval and others highlighted in the llamaindex framework, decision making around embeddings and appropriate distance metrics, extending RAGs to RAG agentic abilities.
  * **Text based Extraction using compound systems**
  * **Robotics and Embedded Systems**

- Broadly my areas of interest(and ability to contribute) span across domains such as ***classical machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, topology and computational neuroscience.*** My experience with multiple startups and working as an AI/ML consultant has allowed me to cultivate a talent for shaping ***product strategies*** and contributing to the ***conception of new product features***
- You can reach me at: titas.das+gh@gmail.com  

- **Fun fact**: I got tired of cooking and the mundane everyday routine it involved while in grad school and built a [robot](https://sites.google.com/site/jullienor2014/homepage) to cut/chop vegetables (*no fancy cuts*). A few years into life, I now find cleaning and cooking therapeutic.
