- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently refining my craft by working on 
  * **Intelligent, adaptive systems** that empower learners to master programming and computer science concepts
  * Exploring everything in the **generative AI** space with a special focus on open source projects - in particular - [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), [Open Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant)

- ðŸŒ± Broadly my areas of interest(and ability to contribute) span across domains such as ***classical machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, topology and computational neuroscience.*** My experience with multiple startups and working as an AI/ML consultant has allowed me to cultivate a talent for shaping ***product strategies*** and contributing to the ***conception of new product features***

- âš¡ **Fun fact**: I got tired of cooking and the mundane everyday routine it involved while in grad school and built a [robot](https://sites.google.com/site/jullienor2014/homepage) to cut/chop vegetables (*no fancy cuts*). A few years into life, I now find cleaning and cooking therapeutic.
