<h2> Hi, I'm titash 👋 </h2>

- 🔭 I’m currently refining my craft by working on 
  * **Intelligent, adaptive systems** that empower learners to master programming and computer science concepts
  * Exploring everything in the **generative AI** space with a special focus on open source projects - in particular - [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), [Open Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant)

- 🔭 I have previously worked on 
  * **Recommendation systems** pertaining to the fashion industry. Experimenting with various optimizations and feedback mechanisms.
  * **Sleep science** detecting and predicting bodily conditions based on biosignals recorded while a person sleeps.
  * **Price modelling** tasks such as adjusting pricing/developing pricing models for marketplaces. 
  * **Natural language processing** tasks such as : entity linking, relation extraction, semantic evaluation pertaining to fairy tales

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the project [Tinytots](https://github.com/TitasDas/Tinytots) . Every now and then also try to fix issues and contribute to [Giveme5W1H](https://github.com/fhamborg/Giveme5W1H). 
- 🌱 Broadly my areas of interest(and ability to contribute) span across domains such as ***classical machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, topology and computational neuroscience.*** My experience with multiple startups and working as an AI/ML consultant has allowed me to cultivate a talent for shaping ***product strategies*** and contributing to the ***conception of new product features***
- 📫 You can reach me at: titas.das+gh@gmail.com  




- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I got tired of cooking and the mundane everyday routine it involved while in grad school and built a [robot](https://sites.google.com/site/jullienor2014/homepage) to cut/chop vegetables (*no fancy cuts*). A few years into life, I now find cleaning and cooking therapeutic.
