### Hi, I'm titash ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently refining my craft by working on
  * **Natural language processing** tasks such as : entity linking, relation extraction, semantic evaluation
  * **Recommendation systems** pertaining to the fashion industry. Mainly experimenting with various optimizations and feedback mechanisms.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the project [Tinytots](https://github.com/TitasDas/Tinytots) . Every now and then also try to fix issues and contribute to [Giveme5W1H](https://github.com/fhamborg/Giveme5W1H). 
- ðŸŒ± Broadly my areas of interest(and ability to contribute) span across domains such as ***classical machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, topology and computational neuroscience.***
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: titas.das+gh@gmail.com  




- âš¡ Fun fact: I got tired of cooking and how much time it took away from my life everyday while in grad school and built a [robot](https://sites.google.com/site/jullienor2014/homepage) to cut/chop vegetables (*no fancy cuts*). A few years into life, I now find cleaning and cooking therapeutic.
