<h2>Hi, I'm Titash <img src="https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SQToH.gif" width="100"></h2>

- Currently working on Retrieval Augmented Generation. 

- Examples of areas/domains where I have been able to contribute in the past are : 
  * **Recommendation systems** pertaining to luxury and fast fashion products, food and entertainment. 
  * **Sleep science** detecting and predicting bodily conditions based on biosignals recorded while a person sleeps.
  * **Price modelling** tasks such as adjusting pricing/developing pricing models for marketplace based businesses Eg: Uber (service oriented marketplace), Amazon (Ecommerce oriented marketplace), Rover (Specialty marketplace). 
  * **Natural language processing** tasks such as : entity linking, relation extraction, semantic evaluation pertaining to fairy tales
  * **Building intelligent, adaptive systems** 

- You can find my updated resume as of February 2023 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mg-NIoH6mSy1pY4gpwvzfkX4O5vbnJem/view?usp=sharing).
- Your AI partner through [ImplantAI](https://implantintelligence.com)

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the project [Tinytots](https://github.com/TitasDas/Tinytots) . Every now and then also try to fix issues and contribute to [Giveme5W1H](https://github.com/fhamborg/Giveme5W1H). 
- Broadly my areas of interest(and ability to contribute) span across domains such as ***classical machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, topology and computational neuroscience.*** My experience with multiple startups and working as an AI/ML consultant has allowed me to cultivate a talent for shaping ***product strategies*** and contributing to the ***conception of new product features***
- You can reach me at: titas.das+gh@gmail.com  

- **Fun fact**: I got tired of cooking and the mundane everyday routine it involved while in grad school and built a [robot](https://sites.google.com/site/jullienor2014/homepage) to cut/chop vegetables (*no fancy cuts*). A few years into life, I now find cleaning and cooking therapeutic.
